## Deploying

1. To deploy this application, download the template from Portal/ArcGIS Online and unzip it.
2. Install npm and run npm install via command line then run `npm run deploy`.
3. Copy the unzipped folder containing the web app template files, such as index.html, to your web server. You can rename the folder to change the URL through which users will access the application. By default the URL to the app will be `http://<Your Web Server>/<app folder name>/index.html`
4. Change the `portalUrl` parameter, found in `application.json` inside the config folder for the application, to the sharing URL for ArcGIS Online or Portal. For ArcGIS Online users, keep the default value of www.arcgis.com or specify the name of your organization.
5. If you are using Portal or a local install of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, change all references to the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in index.html to refer to your local copy of the API. Search for the references containing `"//js.arcgis.com/4.10"` and replace this portion of the reference with the url to your local install.
6. Copy a map or group ID from Portal/ArcGIS Online and replace the default web map ID in the applicationâ€™s `config/applicationBase.js` file. You can now run the application on your web server or customize the application further.
7. Update the parameter `oauthappid` in `config/application.json` or set it to "" if you want to force the user to log in to the application.
